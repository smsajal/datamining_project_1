Question 2:
Fraction of test samples classified correctly, i.e. accuracy = 83.5%
For Class 1: Precision = 95.1%
For Class 1: Recall = 97.5%
For Class 5: Precision = 87.5%
For Class 5: Recall = 77.8%

Question 3:
Naive Bayes: Accuracy: 97.25%
Logistic Regression: Accuracy: 95.41%

The logistic regression was run with 100 iterations and step size 0.1. An example was categorized as class 1, if its probability of being 1 given the data crossed the threshold 0.5. Naive Bayes outperforms Logistic Regression (in terms of accuracy, recall and precision). It also outputs the solution faster.
